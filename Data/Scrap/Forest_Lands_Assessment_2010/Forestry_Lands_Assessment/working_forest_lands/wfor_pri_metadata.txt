    Abstract:
      Conserving Working Forest Lands (FIGURE 1b-2)

      The Conserving Working Forest Lands map shows areas of North Carolina that should be targeted to prevent the loss of working forestlands from development and conversion to other nonforestry uses. These lands have high values for connectivity with other forestlands, water quality protection in existing high-quality waters, habitat for wildlife, and strong markets for hardwood and softwood products. The final component in the map is development risk. With active and informed forest management, these lands can provide economic and ecosystem benefits; in the absence of involved and informed management, they are at higher risk of succumbing to development pressure.
    Purpose:
      The identification of urban and rural priority areas is a requirement of all statewide assessments of forest resources, as specified in the S&PF Redesign guidance developed by the USDA Forest Service: State forest resource assessments will identify, describe, and spatially define forest landscape areas where forestry program outreach and activity will be emphasized and coordinated. Establishment of these priority areas is intended to (1) enable the efficient, strategic, and focused use of limited program resources; (2) address current state and national resource management priorities; and (3) produce the most benefit in terms of critical forest resource values and public benefits. This component of a states assessment should be geospatially based.

      Mapped priority areas provide a method for focusing on areas where federal investment can most effectively stimulate or leverage desired action and engage multiple partners. Mapping must enable the discovery of multistate areas in which collaboration can lead to stronger outcomes. Accomplishments using federal funds may be evaluated against priority areas to determine the effectiveness of S&PF program implementation.
    Supplemental_Information: Two sets of priority maps were developed for North Carolina. The first set (1) shows areas of specific emphasis in North Carolina according to themes identified during the assessment process and (2) aligns with programmatic funding available from USDA Forest Service S&PF. These maps show areas of emphasis for these assessment themes: Conserving Working Forestlands, Protecting Forests and Communities from Wildfire Risk, Threats to Forest Health, and Maintaining Viable Urban Forests. The second set of maps shows overall urban and rural forest priority landscapes.
